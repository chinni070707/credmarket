# CredMarket - Market Research & Feature Recommendations

*Research Date: December 13, 2025*

---

## 🎯 **MARKET POSITIONING INSIGHTS**

Your platform sits in a unique niche between:
- **Consumer marketplaces** (Vinted, Mercari, OfferUp) - focus on trust through ratings
- **Professional networks** (Fishbowl, Blind) - focus on verified corporate identity
- **Hyperlocal platforms** (Nextdoor) - focus on community trust

**Your competitive advantage:** Corporate verification creates inherent trust that consumer platforms lack.
